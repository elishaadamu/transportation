# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

                        The Madison region’s transportation system provides
                        critical connections to commerce, employment, health
                        care, education and recreation, and supports the quick
                        and efcient movement of goods and services. A
                        successfully integrated multi-modal transportation
                        system provides multiple options for commuting,
                        shopping, leisure, and regional travel. Transportation
                        afects the afordability of neighborhoods and
                        communities, as well as the viability of community and
                        economic development. The transportation network also
                        directly infuences quality of life in the region. Safe
                        and efcient regional transportation facilities ensure
                        convenient business and leisure travel, while an
                        integrated, well-connected network makes traveling by
                        all modes convenient and enjoyable. Streets can foster
                        community by acting as community gathering and meeting
                        spaces, and high quality transit and bicycling options
                        are important for employers wanting to attract young,
                        educated, skilled workers.
