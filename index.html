            i have a react js project and i want to achive a certain behaviour,
            i have create component like list, link, paragraph, etc. now i have
            this array in summary.js, i want to loop over this array and then
            display an instance of the content in the order i have arranged it,
            this is how i want it to work, loop over the array, if the first
            content is a section-header, u should add an instance of the
            section-header component to the DOM and then display it content in
            the component, if the next one is a paragraph, you should do the
            same, add the paragraph component to the DOM and then read it
            content, if the next content of the array is another paragraph, then
            it should add another paragraph component to the DOM and then read
            it content, if the next array content is a link, list (li),
            subheader, etc, you should also do the same, take note, its an array
            on objects and each obj has this content (some may not have all
            these content), if an obj has multiple content of the same key, it
            should render all in thier corresponding component in there order.
            For example, if an obj has 5 paragraph the 5 paragraph component
            should be displayed in it right order. do not use typescript for
            this.
